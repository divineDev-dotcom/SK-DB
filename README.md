## Introduction

**SK DB** is a lightweight, promise-based, local JSON database designed to handle **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) along with basic functionalities like **aggregation**, **pagination**, **searching**, and **sorting**. Built entirely using JavaScript, SK DB is optimized for small to medium-scale applications where a full-fledged DBMS would be overkill.

Itâ€™s a simple and fast solution for anyone needing a local data store that works directly with JSON.
